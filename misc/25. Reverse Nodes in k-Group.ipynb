    "Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list _k_ at a time and return its modified list.\n",

    "_k_ is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of _k_ then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`\n",
    "\n",
    "For _k_ = 2, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`\n",
    "\n",
    "For _k_ = 3, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`\n",

    "**Note:**\n",

    "*   Only constant extra memory is allowed.\n",
    "*   You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed."
